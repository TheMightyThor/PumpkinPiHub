# Pumpkin Pi Hub

The website code running on heroku [PumpkinPiHub](htttp://www.pumpkinpihub.club).  The node code is built out of the getting started app from heroku.  I downloaded a free bootstrap template for the initial layout and made modifications as nessessary.
The image looping code was also taken from another developer's library and I made modifications to fit my needs....thanks to those developers.
Accordingly, this code is free to use as well.

The Raspberry Pi code (Python) used to take photos and upload them to aws can be found [here](https://github.com/TheMightyThor/PumpkinPi).
