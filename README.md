# Pumpkin Pi Hub

The website code running on heroku.  The node code is built out of the getting started app from heroku.  I downloaded a free bootstrap template for the initial layout and made modifications as nessessary.
The image looping code was also taken from another developer's library and I made modifications to fit my needs....thanks to those developers.
Accordingly, this code is free to use as well.
